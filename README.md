The **Rate a Post** feature is essential as it allows users to express their opinions on content shared by others, fostering a more interactive and community-driven environment. User feedback is vital for the overall success of the application, as it not only helps in content moderation but also guides future improvements based on user preferences. This iteration is crucial in solidifying a key aspect of user interaction, ultimately contributing to higher user satisfaction and retention.

**Discussion of Changes:**  
The decision to adjust the estimate for the **Rate a Post** feature from 5 days to 10 days was driven by a deeper understanding of the technical requirements involved. The complexity of implementing a robust rating system—considering aspects such as user authentication, data storage, and real-time updates—necessitated dedicating the entire iteration to this single user story. This focus will ensure that the rating feature is not only functional but also user-friendly, offering a smooth experience for users when providing feedback. While this decision does mean postponing other planned functionalities, such as adding new content sharing features, it ultimately strengthens the core user experience. Ensuring that users have a reliable and intuitive way to rate posts sets a solid foundation for future interactions and features.

**Effect:**  
By concentrating our efforts on refining the **Rate a Post** feature, we have significantly improved the quality of user feedback mechanisms within the application.
